## what is terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

## why we need terraform

Terraform is a tool that helps manage and automate your infrastructure (like servers, databases, and networks) using code. Hereâ€™s why you might need it:

1. Consistency:

Repeatable Setups: You can define your infrastructure as code, ensuring the same setup every time.

3. Automation:

Less Manual Work: Automate the creation and management of resources, reducing manual errors.

4. Scalability:

Easy Scaling: Easily add or remove resources based on demand.

5. Multi-Cloud Management:

Flexibility: Manage resources across different cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) from one place.

6. Planning and Transparency:

Preview Changes: See what changes will happen before applying them, preventing surprises.

7. Collaboration:

Team Work: Multiple team members can work on the same infrastructure code, with a clear understanding of the current state.

```
# Install AWS CLI V2
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
which aws
aws --version

# Uninstall AWS CLI V2 (NOT REQUIRED)
which aws
ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws

## Step-05: MACOS: Configure AWS Credentials 
- **Pre-requisite:** Should have AWS Account.
  - [Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)
- Generate Security Credentials using AWS Management Console
  - Go to Services -> IAM -> Users -> "Your-Admin-User" -> Security Credentials -> Create Access Key
- Configure AWS credentials using SSH Terminal on your local desktop
```
# Configure AWS Credentials in command line
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: 
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: WL9G9Tl8lGm7w9t7B3NEDny1+w3N/K5F3HWtdFH/
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json

# Verify if we are able list S3 buckets
aws s3 ls
```
- Verify the AWS Credentials Profile
```
cat $HOME/.aws/credentials 
```

## Step-06: WindowsOS: Terraform & AWS CLI Install
- [Download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Install CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- Unzip the package
- Create new folder `terraform-bins`
- Copy the `terraform.exe` to a `terraform-bins`
- Set PATH in windows 
- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

## Step-07: LinuxOS: Terraform & AWS CLI Install

# Terraform Command Basics

## Step-01: Introduction
- Understand basic Terraform Commands
  - terraform init
  - terraform validate
  - terraform plan
  - terraform apply
  - terraform destroy      

## Step-02: Review terraform manifest for EC2 Instance
- **Pre-Conditions-1:** Ensure you have **default-vpc** in that respective region
- **Pre-Conditions-2:** Ensure AMI you are provisioning exists in that region if not update AMI ID 
- **Pre-Conditions-3:** Verify your AWS Credentials in **$HOME/.aws/credentials**
```t
# Terraform Settings Block
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      #version = "~> 3.21" # Optional but recommended in production
    }
  }
}

# Provider Block
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default" # AWS Credentials Profile configured on your local desktop terminal  $HOME/.aws/credentials
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

# Resource Block
resource "aws_instance" "ec2demo" {
  ami           = "ami-04d29b6f966df1537" # Amazon Linux in us-east-1, update as per your region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

## Step-03: Terraform Core Commands
```t
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Terraform Validate
terraform validate

# Terraform Plan to Verify what it is going to create / update / destroy
terraform plan

# Terraform Apply to Create EC2 Instance
terraform apply 
```

## Step-04: Verify the EC2 Instance in AWS Management Console
- Go to AWS Management Console -> Services -> EC2
- Verify newly created EC2 instance



## Step-05: Destroy Infrastructure
```t
# Destroy EC2 Instance
terraform destroy

# Delete Terraform files 
rm -rf .terraform*
rm -rf terraform.tfstate*
```

## Step-08: Conclusion
- Re-iterate what we have learned in this section
- Learned about Important Terraform Commands
  - terraform init
  - terraform validate
  - terraform plan
  - terraform apply
  - terraform destroy
