## What is IaC?

Infrastructure as code (IaC) means to manage your IT infrastructure using configurationfiles.

## Why IaC?

Historically, managing IT infrastructure was a manual process. People would physically put servers in place and configure them.

Only after the machines were configured to the correct settings required by the OS and dependencies would those people deploy the application.

Businesses are making a transition where traditionally managed infrastructure can no longer meet the demands of today’s businesses. 

IT organizations are quickly adopting the public cloud, which is predominantly API-driven

To meet customer demands and save costs, application teams are architecting their applications to support a much higher level of elasticity, supporting technology like containers and public cloud resources.

## Benefits of IaC

### Speed

IaC benefits a company’s IT architecture and workflow as it uses automation to substantially increase the provisioning speed of the infrastructure’s development,testing, and production.

### Consistency

Since it is code, it generates the same result every time. It provisioned the same environment every time, enabling improved infrastructure consistency at all times.

### Cost

One of the main benefits of IaC is, without a doubt, lowering the costs of infrastructure management. With everything automated and organized, engineers save up on time and cost which can be wisely invested in performing other manual tasks and higher-value jobs.

## Version Controlled, Integrated

Since the infrastructure configurations are codified, we can check-in into version control like GitHub and start versioning it.

IaC allows you to track and give insight on what, who, when, and why anything changed in the process of deployment. This has more transparency which we lack in traditional infrastructure management.

Now, we know what Infrastructure as Code is means, now let’s deep dive into Terraform...

## Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 

Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions which has been developed by HashiCorp
